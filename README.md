#  Welcome to [Propdnd](https://sam-weglinski-airbnb-clone.herokuapp.com/), my clone of AirBnb!

Propdnd, an Airbnb inspired project, is a platform made for travelers looking for a home away from home. Users can access multiple properties available to book for a certain date. After their stay, users can post reviews and images based on their experience. A user is also able to post their own property available for booking if they so desire. Propdnd's goal is to connect people who want to rent out their properties with people who are looking for a place to stay in a specific area.
